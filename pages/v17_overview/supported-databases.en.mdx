# Supported Databases

Vitess deploys, scales and manages clusters of open-source SQL database instances. Currently, Vitess supports the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [Percona Server](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-server) for MySQL databases.

The [VTGate](../v17_concepts/vtgate) proxy server advertises its version as MySQL 8.0.

## MySQL versions 5.7 to 8.0
Vitess supports the core features of MySQL versions 5.7 to 8.0, with [some limitations](../v17_reference/compatibility/mysql-compatibility). Vitess also supports [Percona Server for MySQL](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-server) versions 5.7 to 8.0.

> For new Vitess installations, MySQL or Percona Server for MySQL version 8 are recommended.
